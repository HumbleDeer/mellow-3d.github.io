## Overview

This page covers any general information for the Fly-E3-Pro-v3 board.  
It is currently available through [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002372751834.html). 

### Board.txt Name

The board name in board.txt is **fly_e3_prov3**.

### Z Driver Jumpers

If only one Z output is being used, jumpers should be installed on the other Z output as shown below.

### Driver Diag Pin

To use sensorless homing, a jumper must be installed on the diag header.

### Power Configuration

The Fly-E3-Pro-v3 has two 24v inputs and one ground. The right 24v input powers the MCU and WiFi (as well as anything else that runs from 5v) and the left 24v input powers the motors, heaters and bed. This allows a relay to be used to turn off the motors, heaters and bed using a relay without having to use a separate 5v PSU to power the MCU. A diagragm can be found below.

### Maximum Input voltage

The board can handle an input voltage up to 32v.

### Thermistor inputs

The Fly-E3-Pro-v3 supports PT1000 on the thermistor inputs by using a 2k2 resistor rather than a 4k7.

### Initial Installation

The board that you will receive doesn't have any firmware installed so when plugged into a computer, the board will show as an unidentified device.
