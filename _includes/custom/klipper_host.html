## Klipper Host CAN0 file configuration


{% include important.html content="This guide assumes you have a working Klipper host installation on a Fly Gemini, Fly Pi, Raspberry Pi or compatible device. If you don't have a working installation, please use [kiauh](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh)" %}
 
 - SSH into your Klipper host and create a new can0 file in the /ect/network/interfaces.d folder
 ```
 sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0
 ```

 - Enter the following information. 
``` 
allow-hotplug can0
iface can0 can static
 bitrate 500000
 up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024
 pre-up ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
 pre-up ip link set can0 txqueuelen 1024
 ```
{% include note.html content="The bitrate should match the one used on your tool boards. It can be 250000, 500000 or 1000000. Only use 250000 if you run into timeout issues and cannot fix them by improving the wiring. 500000 or 1000000 are preferred" %}
 

 - Enter Ctrl+X to save the can0 file

 - Reboot your klipper host. 

 - Reconnect to your klipper host using SSH and send `ifconfig`. Make sure the can0 interface is listed.  

 - This should be all you need to do if you are using a Fly UTOC-1, UTOC-3 or {{boardname}} in CAN mode. 
 Other CAN bus adapters may need aditional configuration steps.
