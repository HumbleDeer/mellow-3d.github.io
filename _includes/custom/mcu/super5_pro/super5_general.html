This page covers any general information for the {{boardname}} boards.  
It is currently available through [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805300524621.html).
{% if page.processor == "STM32H723" %}
This is the information for the Fly Super 5 Pro with STM32H723 CPU.  
{% endif %} 
 {% if page.processor == "STM32H723" %}

### Driver Jumpers

The jumpers should be installed as below. "Common Interpolation" should be used for standalone drivers. "SPI mode Interpolation" is supported for TMC5160 drivers. "UART mode Interpolation" should be used when using smart drivers (i.e. TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2225 and TMC2226)

### Driver Diag Pin

The driver diag pin is used for sensorless homing and stall detection.  
The {{boardname}} **does not** have a way of disabling the diag pin as it is designed to be used with [Fly-2209 drivers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001877899893.html) which have a switch on the underside of them for disabling the diag pin.  Set the dip switch to 'ON' to enable the diag pin. 
If you plan on using endstops rather than sensorless homing and do not have the Fly-2209 drivers, you need to bend or remove the diag pin. 

### Fan Mosfets

The {{boardname}} features 2 replacable fan mosfet modules (VS3622e) that control 4 fan outputs.

If the MOSFET is damaged by an accidental short circuit it can easily be replaced. 
New Fly-MOS modules can be purchased from the [Mellow store](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803593540212.html)

The Fan-MOS design allows it to be inserted in either orientation.

### Fan Voltage

The fan voltage can be set using jumpers to either 5v, 12v and Vin.  
Set them as shown below.

### Maximum Input voltage

#### Board/Bed Power

The main board and heated bed power inputs can handle voltage up to 30v.

#### Driver Power

{% if page.processor == "STM32H723" %}
{{boardname}} driver power inputs can handle voltage up to 62v.
